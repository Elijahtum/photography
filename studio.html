      <h3>History of Sting Media Production Studio</h3>

          <p> Sting Media Studio started as a brain child project of 
              Mr Elijah kipruto, who began the studio at a small shop at Rongai town after finishing his form 4 studies. During its early stages he named the shop "Family photo Shop" Elijah began the studio 
              with a simple travelers camera and a photo printer. He then operate the studio by going out to look for clients around the town, take photos of them then come and develop them in the shop.
              He ran this Shop for a period of 2 years. In the year 2014, due to his interest in camera work he joined colledge where 
              he went to pursue a course in film production. <br>After finishing his education in 2017 he then embarked on his previous business.
              In the year 2018, due to constant requests for videos from his clients. Elijah embarked on opening a video studio along side his previous business.
